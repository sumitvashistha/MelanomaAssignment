# Project Name
> melanoma Cancer Detection CNN Assigment using labelled data around 9 cancer classes and image augmentation technique


## Table of Contents
* This project uses the CNN to solve the probem of identification of various cancer cells
* Google Collab, Python Notebook
* Image Augmentation solves the problem of data mismatch and overfit


## General Information
